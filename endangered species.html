	<h2>House Sparrow</h2>
	
	<p>Birds,our chirpy feathered friends, who have amazed us by their aerodynamics and colors, are under great threat. There are 9,934 species of birds that are existing in the world today, out of which a staggering <b>1,313 (13%)</b> are threatened under extinction. <b>House Sparrow</b> is one of them.</p>
	
	<p><b>Sparrows</b>, though tiny, are very sensitive and strongly imune birds, and their sudden disaperance as sentimentals or as ecological indicators is a warning to humans about impending enviroental hazards.</p>
